          <h2>BACKGROUND AND ARTIFACT</h2>
<p>The project of interest is a part of the facility within the Wastewater Treatment Plan in Jakarta. To address the project complexity, the PoI stakeholders have used BIM to coordinate and collaborate effectively. Working within a BIM environment has transformed conventional practices into digital workflow, requiring users to adapt their habits and methods to align with this new way of working.</p>
<p>First, <strong>the </strong><strong>main </strong><strong>pro</strong><strong>cesses</strong> are started with create a BIM Execution Plan (BEP) which is then approved by relevant parties. This is followed by multidisciplinary 3D modelling, comprised of Architecture, Structure, Civil, Mechanical Building (MEB) and Mechanical Equipment &amp; Piping (MEC). However, for this assignment, only the Architectural and Structural disciplines are used due to limited access to the full set of project’s model sources. Subsequently, the model will undergo model federation and clash detection. The stakeholder in each discipline follows a defined scope, software platforms, file formats, and LOD requirements as outlined in the <strong>BEP</strong> (<strong>Appendix 1.1</strong>). The BEP also defines how to conduct the coordination, collaboration and quality control among stakeholders. </p>
<p>The main stakeholders who are involved in this process can be classified into three groups: The employer, the Supervision Consultant, and the Contractor. The employer acts as a final approving authority, ensuring the submitted model and documents align with the project’s objective and required regulations. The Supervision Consultant, consisting of the BIM Manager and BIM Coordinators, is responsible for reviewing and validating the model compliance, issuing the comments, and ensuring the contractor follows the agreed standards and workflows. The Contractor, represented by the Contractor BIM Coordinator, 3D disciplines modellers, and BIM Document Controls develop the models, perform revision, conduct clash detection, manage file submission, and ensure alignment with the agreed standard. The overall<strong> information flow</strong>, from initial modelling to federation, review, approval and storage in CDE, is designed to support transparent communication and efficient decision-making throughout the project lifecycle, as explained in the <strong>Figure</strong><strong> 1.1</strong>.</p>

<h2>REFLECTION</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Challenges in developing BIM Execution Plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Developing a BIM Execution Plan (BEP) for the PoI enabled team members to experience how digital transformation is implemented within the stakeholder body and reshape their coordination and collaboration in the construction project. At the beginning, team members struggled to understand the organization structure, stakeholders&#x27; roles, the connection between modelling, coordination, collaboration and approval within Common Data Environment (CDE). This shows that digital transformation is not only “new software” but a socio-technical change, which governance and roles must be redesigned together with the technology. However, by exploring the given files, carrying out self-research and asking clarification from the lecturer, the team members improved their understanding of how BIM works in real project workflows, and how to use the digital tools, standards and procedures involved. Furthermore, this experience gave us a clearer understanding of how structured information in BIM can enhance communication among the contractor, consultant, and employer. Through this experience, team realised that BEP operationalized information management by defining who produces which information container, when it is exchanged, and how it is checked or approved inside the CDE.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Added Value of BEP for Companies and Organizations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The BEP provides a clear and consistent framework for working in digital environment, allowing the companies and organizations to optimize their work’s process. It reduces misunderstandings by clarifying who delivers what information, when, in which format, and at what level of detail. Communication between stakeholders improves because everyone follows a standardized workflow and shares the same understanding about the expected quality (Borrmann, 2018). BIM value comes from reliable information exchange and process integration (Sacks et. Al, 2025). Working in BIM environment also supports the transition toward a fully digital workflow by standardizing process, improving the quality of digital information, such as cleaner models, consistent naming, fewer errors, and strengthening internal BIM capabilities within the companies and organizations. This will also increase organization interoperability, because shared procedures and common conventions reduce coordination friction between disciplines.</p>
