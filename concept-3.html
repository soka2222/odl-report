          <h2>BACKGROUND AND ARTIFACT</h2>
<p>Constructability within the BIM process is ensured through coordinated interaction between contractor, supervision consultant and client. Within the contractor team, responsibilities are divided between BIM team and project team.</p>
<p>BIM modelers in contractor’s team develop disciplined-specific models (architectural and structural) in Autodesk Revit in accordance with the BEP and shared coordinated system, which are then validated by BIM coordinators before federation. Clash detection and model integration are carried out using Naviswork. The supervision consultant’s BIM team reviews and approves submitted models, ensuring compliance with the client requirements and quality standards. The scheduler/planner and site engineer in contractor’s project team use the coordinated models for 4D simulation, sequencing, and on-site execution, using Synchro Pro and MS Project. Finally, the client reviews and approves the results, focusing on compliance with the contractual and regulatory requirements. Table in Appendix III.1 explains the overview of<strong> </strong>stakeholders who involved to ensure the constructability, their roles, required datasets, and its systems information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clash Detection</em></strong></p>
<p> Appendix III.2 shows the 1st clash detection result from Navisworks by integrating the architectural and structural BIM models. The model highlight clash between the stair and slab elements. To resolve this clash, the slab edge was repositioned and pulled back so that it aligned with the adjacent slab across the supporting beam, as shown in Appendix III.3. Appendix III.4 displays the 2nd clash result, where window opening position intersects with the structural elements. To resolve the clash, the wall and window opening were shifted 60 cm to the left to avoid obstruction with the column, as shown in Appendix III.5. </p>
<p><strong><em>4D Animation</em></strong></p>
<p>4D animation is generated by combining schedule and the model data (Appendix III.6), which exposed the potential conflict that will be encountered during execution. The crane for installing wall clashes with the nearby building will be in conflict because they are performed simultaneously. To resolve this issue, the construction sequence was modified to prioritize the installation of all architectural wall elements in the south area, which is closest to the neighbouring building, as it shown in Appendix III.7. By removing this problem, wall installation will be completed before the construction of nearby building begins. The full version of the artifact can be accessed via the OneDrive link: . </p>
<h2>REFLECTION</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Challenges in </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>eveloping </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>rtifacts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Clash detection:</em></strong></p>
<p>Clash found in the architecture with the structural model most likely occurred in the 3D model, because sometimes it is related with the boundary definition of each system. However, the clashes are mostly related to wall with the structural component (beam or column) and could be ignored since it has no huge negative impact to the system, and the contractor can easily adjust it during the architectural installation. Meanwhile, there are several clashes which could cause higher impact during the construction such as stair installation and window opening location. In conclusion, the biggest challenge during clash detection is how do we prioritize which clashes which have significant impact during the construction that we should resolve, and which clashes could be ignored and adjusted during project execution.</p>
<p><strong><em>4D Modelling</em></strong></p>
<p>Doing 4D modelling in Naviswork has limitation, which we could not edit the schedule real time in the application. Instead, we have to edit the Microsoft Project file, and then re-import it to the Naviswork. Since our modification is somehow iterative, it takes a lot of time and effort. Therefore, Synchro Pro was utilized, as it integrates 3D modelling and scheduling within a single application, side by side. This helped us to validate visually in the real time, and faster iteration during 4D modelling. It also accelerated us when we encountered the problem in the artifact and performed the resolve action. 4D modelling is effective when planner can iterative quickly and and use visualization to do the sequencing assumptions.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Improved Decision-Making Through Clash Detection and 4D BIM</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By performing the clash detection and 4D BIM simulation, the project team can identify the design conflicts at early stage, allowing them to assess its potential impact on construction activities before the execution phase. Clash detecting at an early phase allows the team to resolve the design before construction begins. The sequencing adjustment in 4D artifact reduces spatial conflicts, improve site logistics, reduce potential delays, and decrease safety hazards during execution. 4D model becomes a coordination object that supports shared understanding between BIM team, planning team, and site team.</p>
<p>The analysed results enable the team to distinguish between the critical and non-critical clashes, thus followed them up with the most appropriate responds, which issues required immediate intervention, and which can be resolved during construction. This will reduce uncertainty and improving confidence in the proposed construction approach. A further improvement would be to formalize prioritization rule explicitly (hard clash vs tolerable clash), so the process could be repeatable (Borrmann, 2018)</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Potential Future Enhancements and Integration Opportunities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With additional time and resources, the artifacts could be further improved by developing mechanical and electrical (ME) and modelling all buildings within the project rather than only focus on Sludge Treatment Building. This would allow more comprehensive clash detection and scheduling issue across all facilities, such integrating traffic management plan. Additionally, we could also develop more model to represent temporary works and construction logistics. This would make clash detection and 4D scheduling more constructability oriented and make more efficient site planning with optimized resources. Temporary works, logistics objects and access zones are important to make 4D construction more realistic not only design realistic.</p>
