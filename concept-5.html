          <h2>BACKGROUND AND ARTIFACT</h2>
<p>Construction sustainability can be supported through a BIM-based information system application. In this assignment, sustainability is evaluated using embodied carbon which represents the environmental impact associated with the material extraction, manufacturing, transportation and installation. This process involves multiple stakeholders who contributes from different roles. The following table explains stakeholders who are involved in ensuring sustainability, what datasets are integrated and its information systems source.</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table><tr><th>Stakeholder</th><th>Role in the BIM Process</th><th>Datasets Used / Produced</th><th>Applications / Information Systems</th></tr><tr><td>Architect</td><td>Material choices to minimize the carbon produced during operation, and to optimize the u value of the building</td><td>U Value</td><td>Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Insight</td></tr><tr><td>Contractor</td><td>Minimize carbon generated during construction</td><td>Embodied carbon</td><td>Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Insight</td></tr><tr><td>Client</td><td>Determine the sustainability target (in this case operational and embodied carbon) to evaluate the ESG performance.</td><td>ESG Reporting</td><td>Autodesk Insight</td></tr><tr><td>Asset Manager</td><td>Optimize operational carbon during building life cycle</td><td>Annual Energy use</td><td>Autodesk Insight</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainability Consultant</td><td>Integrating circularity in the building design by material selection and developing the material passport</td><td>Material Passport</td><td>Madaster</td></tr></table></div>
<p>After using Autodesk Insight to perform the embodied carbon analysis, the results indicate that the model has a total carbon impact of approximately 1.96 million kgCO2e, with operational carbon accounting for around 1.8 million, while the remaining is embodied carbon. The full description of the analysis result is shown in Appendix V.1.</p>
<h2>REFLECTION</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Challenges in developing the artifacts </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, the model could not be analysed using Autodesk Insight’s energy analysis function. Upon our examination, it was identified that the issues are due to missing windows and doors in the 3D model, which prevented the software to correctly defining the building envelope. To resolve this, we added the windows and doors in the 3D model based on the 2D shop drawing that we received from the project. The action resulted in the analysis could be performed in Autodesk Insight. However, only embodied carbon was shown in the dashboard. This limitation was traced to the absence of properly defined spaces and rooms, as well as inconsistencies in the project coordinate base in the model. After having the required modification done, the model can successfully be processed by Autodesk Insight, enabling the generation of complete set of results, embodied carbon and operational energy outputs.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>How </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>hese artifacts </strong><strong>help</strong><strong> to improve project sustainability metrics</strong><strong> and decision making</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The artifact helps us as a project manager to give quantitative information about the embodied carbon and operational carbon in the building. Since we know both values, this will influence the decision making during the design phase of the project. Beside the cost, constructability, and structural properties, the project manager will also be equipped with carbon information of the material, the project manager can also consider the trade-off between that information. Using model based analysis to compare design alternatives and make transparent trade ofss is a key BIM value (Sacks, et al., 2025). Moreover, the project manager can also prioritize which elements has the biggest impact to the carbon emission, so he can focus to prioritize which part of building should be redesigned or optimized to do the carbon reduction. </p>
<p>For instance, in this model, the analysis results show that the largest contributor of the total carbon impact is at the operational stage. With this information, the project manager can prioritize operational performance decisions over material substitution that will not significantly reduce the total carbon. Project managers can suggest using better glazing or shading to improve high-efficiency HVAC systems that will reduce operational carbon and costs, which dominate the results.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Future improvement and </strong><strong>Opportunities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With additional time and resources, these artifacts could be further enhanced by linking the BIM model to material passport platform such as Madaster. While this would not significantly influence operational carbon, its analysed material passport results would provide valuable information that could be added in the existing model such as material composition, reuse potential and residual value at the end of building life cycle. This extended analysis would aid the project manager to incorporate circularity indicators into decision-making, completing carbon emission performance assessments and supporting more comprehensive sustainability strategies. From an information system perspective, this also improves data continuity into operation and end of life cycle by connecting BIM objects to verified material identity and recovery value.
